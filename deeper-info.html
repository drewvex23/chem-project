            <p class="left-side-text">Chlorine was founded in the year 1774 by Carl Wihelm Schelle (Pictured Above). Chlorine in the gas state was used as an airborne weapon during WWI and killed over 1,100 in its first use. At the time being, Germans were unable to counter the effectiveness which shortly changed, making the chlorine gas being used as a weapon short-lived.</p>

            <h2 class="header-left">Interesting Facts:</h2>
            <p class="left-side-text">Something “wow” about Chlroine: <br>Chlorine was the first poisonous gas used as a weapon during WWI and is now used today in industrial and household cleaning products.</p>
            <p class="left-side-text">Price/value of Chlroine: <br>~$0.45 per pound of chlorine gas</p>
            <p class="left-side-text">Common isotopes of Chlorine (including where they are found): <br>There are two common isotopes, chlorine-35 and chlorine-37. Both chlorine-35 and chlorine-37 are usually found occurring in nature as sodium chloride in seawater.</p>
            <p class="left-side-text">Common ionic compounds chlorine creates using the oxidation numbers: <br>
                - Chlorine gas (Cl2) has an oxidation number of 0, as it is in its elemental form. <br>
                - In chloride ions (Cl-), chlorine has an oxidation number of -1. <br>
                - In hypochlorite ions (ClO-), chlorine has an oxidation number of +1. <br>
                - In chlorate ions (ClO3-), chlorine has an oxidation number of +5. <br>
                - In perchlorate ions (ClO4-), chlorine has an oxidation number of +7. <br>
                - In chlorine dioxide (ClO2), chlorine has an oxidation number of +4.

            <h2 class="header-right">Chemical and Physical Properties:</h2>
            <h3 class="header2-right">Chemical Properties:</h3>
            <p class="right-side-text">- Chlorine is highly reactive with other elements such as metals which form chlorides and hydrogens which form hydrogen chloride.</p>
            <p class="right-side-text">- Chlorine has a strong oxidizing property that helps it to break down chromophores in colored substances, making them colorless, this is why it is a great ingredient used in bleaching agents.</p>
            <h3 class="header2-right">Physical Properties:</h3>
            <p class="right-side-text">- Chlorine is a greenish yellow gas at room temperature</p>
            <p class="right-side-text">- Chlorine is 2 ½ times heavier than air</p>
